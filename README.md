<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Through our experience with using the NUS Lost and Found website, we noticed how difficult it was to identify whether an item on the website was the one we lost. There is only a short generic text description of the lost item and thus we had to go down to the lost and found point to identify the item. We believe that a better interface could be created to reduce the hassle for people who have lost items on campus. 

Our goal for our Orbital project is to create a one stop site for users who have found a lost item and users who are looking for a lost item. We hope to reduce the hassle and time taken to search for a lost item. Our platform’s Gallery page displays items that have been found in an intuitive manner with images. In addition, our platform also has a Noticeboard which allows users to post items they have lost.

In short, our platform helps people recover their lost items in the shortest possible time with an easy-to-use and intuitive web application that caters to both users who lost their personal items, as well as users who found misplaced items.
